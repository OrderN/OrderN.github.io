summary: DFT study of undoped and As-doped Si nanowires approaching the bulk limit
---
We studied Si nanowires, both undoped and doped, concentrating on the electronic structure.  
We show that, for the undoped nanowires, the DFT bandgap reduces with increasing
diameter and converges to its bulk value, a trend in agreement with experimental
data. When considering As-doped Si nanowires we show that dopant placement within the
nanowire plays an important role in deciding electronic properties.
