summary: DFT study of undoped and As-doped Si nanowires approaching the bulk limit
---
We studied Si nanowires, both undoped and doped, concentrating on the electronic structure[1]. 
We show that, for the undoped nanowires, the DFT bandgap reduces with increasing
diameter and converges to its bulk value, a trend in agreement with experimental
data. When considering As-doped Si nanowires we show that dopant placement within the
nanowire plays an important role in deciding electronic properties. It
