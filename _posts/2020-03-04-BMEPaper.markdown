summary: Paper using CONQUEST to explore hydration of anti-cancer drugs
---
We have submitted a paper to Inorganic Chemistry which uses CONQUEST
to perform blue-moon ensemble (BME) MD calculations for the hydration
(aquation) free energy of platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs.
The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01418).
