summary: O(N) DFT and Sakurai–Sugiura method efficiently simulating 10000+ atoms
---
We propose an efficient way to calculate the electronic structure of large systems
by combining a large-scale first-principles density functional theory code,
Conquest, and an efficient interior eigenproblem solver, the Sakurai–Sugiura method. [1]
