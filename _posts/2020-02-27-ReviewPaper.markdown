summary: Paper giving overview of CONQUEST methodology and applications
---
We have submitted a paper to Journal of Chemical Physics which gives
an overview of the methodology implemented in CONQUEST, both linear
scaling and large scale DFT.  We discuss the pseudopotential libraries
that we use, and the basis functions that are available.  We also
provide details of some recent applications of CONQUEST.
The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05768).
