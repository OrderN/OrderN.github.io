summary: CONQUEST is used to study a cobalt phosphide catalyst for hydrogenation of furfural derivatives
---
While metal phosphides have begun to attract attention as
electrocatalysts, they remain underutilized in the field of
liquid-phase molecular transformations. Herein, we describe a
supported cobalt phosphide nanoalloy (nano-Co2P) that functions as a
highly efficient, reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the selective
hydrogenation of furfural derivatives. The carbonyl moieties of
several furfural derivatives were selectively hydrogenated to produce
the desired products in high yields. In contrast to conventional
nonprecious metal catalysts, nano-Co2P uniquely exhibited air
stability, which enabled easy and safe handling and precluded the need
for H2 pretreatment. Infrared and density functional theory studies
revealed that the highly efficient hydrogenation is due to the
favorable activation of the carbonyl moiety of furfural derivatives
through the backdonation to its Ï€* orbital from the Co d-electrons.
