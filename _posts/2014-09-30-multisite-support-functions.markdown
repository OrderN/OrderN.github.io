summary: A new approach to support functions
---
A new approach to support functions has been implemented in Conquest,
allowing us to use basis functions from multiple sites[1]. The work was
performed by Ayako Nakata and Tsuyoshi Miyazaki, and is available on
[arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3689).
