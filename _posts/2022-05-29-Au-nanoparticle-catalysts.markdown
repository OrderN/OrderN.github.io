summary: CONQUEST was used to study anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts

Although supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts have been
theoretically investigated for their efficacy in activating O2 in
aerobic oxidation reactions, limited studies have been reported due to
the difficulty of designing these catalysts. Herein, we developed a
feasible method for preparing supported anionic gold nanoparticle
catalysts using multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates with high
negative charges. We confirmed the strong and robust electronic
interaction between gold nanoparticles and multivacant lacunary
polyoxometalates, and the electronic states of the supported gold
nanoparticle catalysts can be sequentially modulated. Particularly,
the catalyst prepared using [SiW9O34]10âˆ’ acted as an efficient
reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing superior catalytic
performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone
derivatives to the corresponding enaminones and remarkably higher
stability than supported gold nanoparticle catalysts without this
modification.
