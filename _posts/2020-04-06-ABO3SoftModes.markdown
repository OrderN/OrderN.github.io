summary: Paper testing the CONQUEST basis sets on PTO, PZO and PZT
---
We have submitted a paper to Electronic Structure which tests the
accuracy of CONQUEST PAO basis sets by comparing the charge density to
fully converged plane wave results (from the Abinit code).  We explore
soft-mode distortions in PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (PTO), PbZrO<sub>3</sub>
(PZO) and PZT.  We find
that DZP and TZTP basis sets give excellent comparisons and are
reliable, and show an example plot below.  The paper is available on
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05327).

The charge density difference between PAO calculations and plane-waves
 for increasing PAO basis set size for cubic PTO (a) and cubic PZO
 (b). For each case, we display the full 3d isosurfaces and slices
 through the PbO and BO2 planes. Isosurfaces are plotted at the +0.10
 (dark red), +0.020 (light red) and -0.020 (blue) electrons/A<sup>3</sup> levels.
