summary: CONQUEST is used to provide ab initio MD data for fitting machine learning forces
---
An unsupervised machine learning (ML) method is proposed to analyse the local structure around an atom, using a novel two-step locality-preserving projection.  CONQUEST is used in linear scaling mode to produce MD data on 1,000 atoms of silicon and a silicon-germanium alloy to fit the ML forces.
