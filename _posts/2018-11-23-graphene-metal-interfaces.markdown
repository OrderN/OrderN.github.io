summary: calculating the properties of a graphene-metal system on a large scale
---
In this work, we calculate the electronic and structural properties of a graphene–metal
system significantly larger than in previous plane-wave calculations with the same accuracy.
For this task we use a localised basis set with the Conquest code, both in their primitive,
pseudo-atomic orbital form, and using a recent multi-site approach. [1]
