summary: A study showing the accuracy of Conquest pseudo-atomic basis sets
---
We present an approach to the generation of highly accurate
pseudo-atomic orbital (PAO) basis sets, and test them on a wide
variety of systems[1].  We show that basis sets comparable to converged
plane wave accuracy can be generated automatically.  It is available
