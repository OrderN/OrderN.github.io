summary: studying the structural properties of Si/Ge and Ge/Si core-shell nanowires
---
Core–shell nanowires made of Si and Ge can be grown experimentally with excellent control
for different sizes of both core and shell. We have studied the structural properties of Si/Ge
and Ge/Si core–shell nanowires aligned along the  direction, with diameters up to 10.2 nm and
varying core to shell ratios, using linear scaling density functional theory. [1]
