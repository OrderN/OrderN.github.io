summary: CONQUEST is used to study topologically protected vortices and ferromagnetic domain walls in YGaO3

Ferroelectric behavior on the meso- and macroscopic scale depends on
the formation and dynamics of domains and controlling the domain
patterns is imperative to device performance. While density functional
theory (DFT) calculations have successfully described the basic
properties of ferroelectric domain walls, the necessarily small cell
sizes used for the calculations hampers DFT studies of complex domain
patterns. Here, we simulate large-scale complex ferroelectric domain
patterns in ferroelectric YGaO 3 using multisite local orbitals as
implemented in the DFT code conquest. The multisite local orbital
basis set gives similar bulk structural and electronic properties, and
atomic domain wall structures and energetics as those obtained with
conventional plane-wave DFT. With this basis set model, 3600-atom
cells are used to simulate topologically protected vortices. The local
atomic structure at the vortex cores is subtly different from the
domain walls, with a lower electronic band gap suggesting enhanced
local conductance at these cores.
