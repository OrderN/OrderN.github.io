summary: CONQUEST is used to study the alignment of ferroelectric domain walls with surface trenches in lead titanate thin films
---
Ferroelectric (FE) domain walls (DWs) have been observed in parallel
alignment with surface and substrate defects since the 2000s.  Now
that electrically conducting FE DWs have been realized, new horizons
for nanoelectronic devices approach. That is, the phenomenon now
promises control over the orientation of 2D conducting channels on the
nanoscale; a potential pathway for fabricating DW- mediated
nanocircuits with standard lithographical techniques.  Using ultrathin
PbTiO3 films as a model system, we explore this mechanism with large
scale density functional theory simulations on as many as 5,136
atoms. Although we expect multiple contributing factors, we show that
parallel DW-ST alignment can be well explained by this configuration
giving rise to an arrangement of electric dipole moments which best
restore polar continuity to the film.
