summary: A review of multi-site support functions (MSSFs) in CONQUEST
---
This article reviews a large-scale DFT calculation method, the multi-site support function (MSSF) method, in the CONQUEST code. MSSFs are linear combinations of the basis functions which belong to a group of atoms in a local region. The method can reduce the computational time while preserving accuracy.
