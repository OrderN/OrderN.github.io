summary: Implementation of O(N) NVT MD in CONQUEST
---
We have implemented and tested Nos√©-Hoover chains for constant temperature (NVT) molecular dynamics within the extended-Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer (XL-BOMD) framework, and demonstrated excellent conservation for complex systems up to 1500K.[1]

The research has been submitted to J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, and is available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01448)
