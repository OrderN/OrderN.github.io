summary: A study of the GramicidinA ion channel using CONQUEST
---
A Conquest study of the gramicidinA ion channel has been published in
[J. Roy. Soc.:Interface](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2013.0547)[1] . The study
uses exact diagonalisation to
assess the effect of side-chains on the potential in the channel, and tests the
range required for accurate linear scaling calculations.

We find that the side chains do not change the channel potential, as shown in the
figure below, which compares the electrostatic potential for the complete ion channel
(1MAG structure from PDB) and an artificial channel where all side chain amino
acids have been replaced with alanine.

A preprint is available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0090).

DFT electrostatic potential [eV]: (a)-(c) are cross sections perpendicular to
the channel axis (z) at 9.6 A from the centre of the channel. (a) 1MAG geometry;
(b) alanine channel;(c) 1MAG and alanine channel potential difference. Note the
different scale in (c). (d) and (e) are also potential difference between 1MAG
and alanine channel, but cross sections along the channel axis, xz and yz
planes, respectively.
