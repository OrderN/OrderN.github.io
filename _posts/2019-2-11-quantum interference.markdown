summary: Measuring the effects of quantum interference on charge transport
---
A joint experimental and theoretical study on the conductance of
single molecules, with CONQUEST used as the electronic structure
component of the conductance calculations.  The study used
electrochemical gating to measure the conductance and map the
transmission functions of single molecules at and around the Fermi
energy, and to study signatures associated with constructive and
destructive interference. The quantum interference between the highest
occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital was
tuned using an electrochemical gate, and anti-resonance, a distinct
feature of destructive interference, was directly observed[1].
