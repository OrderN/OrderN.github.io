summary: Measuring the effects of quantum interference on charge transport
---
Here, by means of electrochemical gating, we measure the conductance and map the
transmission functions of single molecules at and around the Fermi energy, and study
signatures associated with constructive and destructive interference. With electrochemical
gate control, we tune the quantum interference between the highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and directly observe anti-resonance, a
distinct feature of destructive interference. [1]
