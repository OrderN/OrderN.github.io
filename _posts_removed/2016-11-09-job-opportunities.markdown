FIRST-PRINCIPLES SIMULATION GROUP, NANO-THEORY FIELD
INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR MATERIALS NANOARCHITECTONICS (MANA)
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE (NIMS), TSUKUBA, JAPAN

One or two post-doctoral positions are available at the International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), National Institute for Materials Science(NIMS) in Tsukuba, Japan. The initial appointment will be for one year, but can be renewed subject to performance.

NIMS is one of the world’s largest materials research centers, and the first-principles simulation group in NIMS-MANA has a strong focus on materials modeling using first-principles methods based on density functional theory. The successful candidate(s) will work on the development of large-scale electronic structure calculation methods and implementing new methods in the linear-scaling DFT code CONQUEST.

 CONQUEST code: [http://www.linear-scaling.org](http://www.linear-scaling.org)

The candidate(s) are also expected to perform theoretical studies of nano-scale materials, like complex semiconductor surfaces, nanowires, biological systems, and so on, using the CONQUEST code. 

More information about the group and the institute can be found at: [http://www.nims.go.jp/cmsc/fps1/](http://www.nims.go.jp/cmsc/fps1/) and [http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/index.html](http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/index.html)

The project will be performed in close collaboration with the groups of Prof. D. R. Bowler at the London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL, London, and Dr. L. Truflandier at Universite de Bordeaux, France.  Applicants must have, or expect to obtain before the start of the work, a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline. A strong background in theoretical condensed matter science and experience with electronic structure methods are essential. 

The deadline for applications is Dec 5th, 2016, but the search for candidates will continue until the position is filled. 

Candidates should send the following by e-mail in Word, pdf or html format:
1. CV (with Photo)
2. List of publications
3. Reprints of three selected papers 
4. Summary of past accomplishments 
5. Names and e-mail addresses of two referees.
